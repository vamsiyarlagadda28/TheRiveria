          <img src="/Images/mc1.jpeg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>By using interceptro ships like these we can clean floating plastic on rivers easily. No one river is the same. 
          Factors like river width, depth, flow speed, debris composition, seasonality, and tides all have a major influence
           on the success of a river intervention. To tackle different types of scenarios, we have a family of technology 
           solutions to choose from, ranging from high tech to low tech. Besides the ones listed below, we investigate the 
           most suitable and effective ways to intercept plastic in other rivers on a case-by-case evaluation, and more 
           solutions will be added to our portfolio.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Mr. Trash Wheel is an anthropomorphic trash interceptor with googly eyes and his own Twitter account. Built and put
           in place by Clearwater Mills and the Waterfront Partnership, he has been gobbling up trash and floating plastic out
            of the Jones Fall River in Baltimore since 2014. In 2016 he was joined by the female-gendered Professor Trash Wheel,
             and with Captain Trash Wheel launched in 2018 in Brooklyn. The fleet of river cleanup vessels has collected a total
              of 907 tons of rubbish. The vessels are powered by waterwheels and the river's current, with solar panels for backup
               on slower days. Debris is collected by floating barriers and the wheels power a conveyor belt that transfers the 
               rubbish out of the water and into a bin. On April 20, 2015, after the first significant rain storm of the season,
                Mr. Trash Wheel removed 19 tons of garbage from Baltimore's waterfront on that one day. </p>

          <img src="/Images/m3.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Started in Australia by two surfers and sailors, they saw the issue of plastic in the ocean firsthand and decided to do
           something about it. They came up with a plan to build a giant pool skimmer, that would collect trash and plastic that
            gathers in harbors and marinas, before it reaches the ocean. Using recycled plastic, stainless steel and a water pump, 
            they built the first Seabin. It proved to collect a significant amount of plastic and in 2017, Wärtsilä, a leader in 
            marine and sustainable technolgy partnered with Seabin. Since then, Wärtsilä has donated 40 Seabins in various locations
             globally. Now there are more than 860 Seabins in total worldwide and together, they can capture 7,965 lbs of floating plastic 
             and debris every day. The filter removes plastic particles down to 2mm, and also soaks up and removes gas and oil from the water.
            Like all projects, it is a work in progress. While the bin itself is 100 percent recyclable, the Seabin team is still working 
            to develop a recycled material catch-bag and they have done testing using solar panels as a zero-carbon power option. The 
            Seabin Project knows its product isn't perfect, and they are always looking for ways to improve it, but it is a great step 
            in the right direction.</p>

          <center><h2>THE GREAT BUBBLE BARRIER</h2></center>
          <img src="/Images/m4.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>The Plastic Whale isn't the only Dutch ocean-bound plastic solution. The Great Bubble Barrier is a system installed in an
           Amsterdam canal in November 2019 which cleans the waterway using just bubbles. The idea, like many of these, originated
            from three friends who shared a passion for sailing and became concerned about the amount of plastic waste they saw in
             the water. The inspiration came one day when Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet, and Saskia Studer were talking over 
             drinks. “One day they were drinking a beer in a bar,” says Sandy Reitsma of Great Bubble Barrier, “and discussing the 
             problem of plastics in the ocean. One of them was looking at the bubbles in the beer and that was the start of the idea."
             The three women took their idea to the public and received funding from the Postcode Lotteries Green Challenge award and 
             other prizes. They met a German naval architect and ocean engineer, Philip Ehrhorn, who had come up with a similar idea 
             when watching bubbles in a water treatment plant bring waste plastics to the surface. The two projects come together and 
             the Great Bubble Barrier was created.</p>

          <center><h2>FLOATING BOOM</h2></center>
          <img src="/Images/m6.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>As one of the five Cleaning Litter by Developing and Applying Innovative Methods in European Seas (CLAIM) projects run by
           the EU, a floating boom has been installed at the mouth of the Kifissos River in Athens, Greece.
          The floating boom is called the Tactical Recovery System Hellas, or TRASH, and was manufactured by New Naval. Since then, Wärtsilä has donated 40 Seabins in various locations
          globally. Now there are more than 860 Seabins in total worldwide and together, they can capture 7,965 lbs of floating plastic 
          and debris every day. The filter removes plastic particles down to 2mm, and also soaks up and removes gas and oil from the water.
         Like all projects, it is a work in progress. While the bin itself is 100 percent recyclable, the Seabin team is still working 
         to develop a recycled material catch-bag and they have done testing using solar panels as a zero-carbon power option.
          Using technology New Naval developed for responding to oil spills, the mesh barriers collect river plastic and channels it 
          towards a floating cage. This is used to lift the plastic up to the level of the harbor wall so it can be removed. To me, 
          this one looks like it could be improved on as the emptying process seems a little hokey. Nevertheless, they are making a 
          difference with this river cleanup project.</p>

          <center><h2>RIVER CLEANING SYSTEM</h2></center>
          <img src="/Images/m7.webp" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>In 2019, in an effort to address the rising oil and plastic waste issues, the company has developed an innovative, unique,
           and efficient system called River Cleaning, that prevents plastic waste and oil pollutants floating on the surface of 
           watercourses from entering the sea, while also allowing navigability and having no detrimental effect whatsoever on flora
            and fauna. The solution consists of a series of round floating devices, positioned diagonally on the course of the river. 
            They are anchored with flexible lines, to a rail at the bottom of the river. As they spin from the current they can intercept
             plastic waste and move the trash to the riverbank, into a special storage area. Due to the way they are anchored, they can 
             adjust for changes in water levels and can do not hinder boat traffic, The system has a low environmental impact solution, 
             does not require any power source other than the kinetic energy of the moving water, and does not produce any kind of waste. 
            Furthermore, technology has recently been further developed with a plugin-integration: an absorption system for the oil pollutants
             floating on the surface of the rivers.</p>
